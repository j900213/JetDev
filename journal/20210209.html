        <p>Alright, here I am, the third day journaling.</p>
        <p>
          I finally settle down the name of this website: LazyCoder, and
          registered a cool domain name. There is no reason why I decided to use
          this particular domain name, it just sounds right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today I spent a whole day setting up PMP environment, and oh gosh, it
          has so many steps and I have not done it yet. Nonetheless, I stick
          with Pomodoro method for a whole day, which actually made me feel
          quite good. In particular, I downloaded &#x27;Tide&#x27; back, one of
          my favorite app when studying at TUe, I wish I made this decision
          earlier, it really helped me focus a lot more easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          I talked to Olivier for the first time in the morning, I feel he is a
          really nice and smart guy. It is definitely a good thing: having
          someone who also has little experience as I do, so I can learn things
          from him and keep motivated (because I don&#x27;t want to lose).
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan to go to the office tomorrow. There is still a lot snow on the
          road, so I think it is gonna be a memorable experience.
        </p>
        <p>Hope I will be safe and healthy tomorrow, talk to you later.</p>
