          So everyday I planned to start writing the journal earlier, but I keep
          failing to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, here I am, at 10 p.m., just finished adding a burger menu on
          this website. I used a pure CSS way to do so, feels a bit stupid but
          hey, it works.
        </p>

          I had a call with Olivier today, he is definitely a nice guy, really
          really kind. But I think I can&#x27;t &#x27;overuse&#x27; him:
          don&#x27;t ask too many stupid questions. I didn&#x27;t manage to go
          to the office today, but tomorrow I will have to since Giel is
          probably coming for me. So, no more excuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of work, I was again pretty lazy today, because the work is
          kind of blocked, so I don&#x27;t feel as guilty as I am supposed to.
          Pomodoro method is still doing it&#x27;s magic, helping me focus more
          than I used to be. I will definitely stick with it.
        </p>

          The stepper I bought was delivered toady, it is AWESOME! For real, it
          s not the best quality product and I would not say it will very
          effective, but I think it is a perfect way to keep my body move when
          watching TV/YouTube ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel pretty good today, I hope tomorrow will be a great day as well.
        </p>

          (I know, my journal&#x27;s content feels like written by someone from
          a primary school)
