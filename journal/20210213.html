        <p>Okay, happy birthday, you are officially 27 now.</p>
        <p>
          This year&#x27;s birthday is a bit strange. I am not kind of the
          person who celebrates a birthday. That being said, I really don&#x27;t
          feel ANY excitement this year. I used to &#x27;try not to care&#x27;
          about it, but this time I really don&#x27;t care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does it mean that I am old/mature enough? Maybe. Or maybe I have
          become that kind of adult who cares nothing but numbers. Maybe I have
          already lost the ability to get excited about any romantic stuff. It
          is very likely.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent half of the day cleaning up the room and myself (cutting hair,
          shaving). Literally did nothing today, but I felt quite satisfied.
          There was a moment yesterday when I felt long hair really doesn&#x27;t
          suit me, I look very lame with it. So I decided to cut it today, I am
          quite happy that I am back to who I was 5 months ago (appearance
          wise).
        </p>
        <p>
          I received a couple of birthday wishes, which is indeed quite
          surprising considering that I don&#x27;t show any public profile
          anymore. Also a birthday card from Yu-Chun. To be fairly honest, I am
          not a big fan of what is written on the card (lol), she complains too
          much. Anyways, at least I received something on my birthday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great news is: I got Amber this morning at Brawl Star! This is
          literally the best thing that could happen on this birthday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am gonna end here, tomorrow I shall work a bit and also read some
          books. I gotta keep the life going, good night.
