        <p>Alright, so tomorrow is my birthday, I almost forgot that.</p>
        <p>
          Today was pretty busy and tiring, we held Eindhoven Taiwanese Pubquiz,
          glad that I am able to bring some fun to the community. The result
          wasn&#x27;t perfect since it was online and I did not put much effort
          as I did in the previous year. But anyways I still feel happy. I
          really hope next time (if there is a next time) it can be physical.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of work, I started feeling stressful. This time is not
          because of the pressure coming from others, it is because of the fact
          that I don&#x27;t want to seem too stupid compared to Olivier (oh
          gosh, he is really smart). On one hand this stress is a good thing as
          it can motivate me. On the other hand, I am afraid that I will feel
          more and more depression.
        </p>
        <p>I really need to be a tougher guy.</p>
        <p>Maybe this can be my first birthday wish? Why not.</p>
        <p>
          Here comes a weekend, I hope I can plan something meaningful tomorrow,
          don&#x27;t waste too much free time Jet, you don&#x27;t have much
          anymore.
