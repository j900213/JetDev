        <p>Yes, I skipped one day, I am a badass.</p>
        <p>
          Last night I was desperately trying to make &#x27;sending commands to
          the power supply&#x27; work before today, but with no surprise, I
          failed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I said goodbye to MULTI SW team in a weird way this morning, (again)
          with no surprise, nobody seemed to care. Snorri introduced me to the
          PMP team this morning, I kind of had a feeling between excited and
          fearful: excited about changing to a new working environment, fearful
          about messing up again.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be honest, this afternoon I fell back to my lazy mode as soon as I
          realized my work was to setup the new developing environment, because
          I thought it was easy. And I procrastinated again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really hate myself after joining to Prodrive, I achieved nothing
          when there is no pressure. I need to stick with Pomodoro, I swear.
        </p>
        <p>
          It snowed heavily again today, which makes the Netherlands look so
          different. I took a short walk today after work, it had become hard to
          walk on the road and almost impossible to cycle. But as a person who
          comes from semi-tropical country, I like this white scene a lot. I
          plan to go out and take some photos tomorrow (during lunch break and
          after work).
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, I felt happy when I heard Yu-Chun said she wanted to buy a
          coffee machine to me as the birthday gift. Of course I refused it (cuz
          I can afford it myself), but I was glad she thought about me.
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, Pomodoro, Pomodoro, Pomodoro! Talk to you tomorrow.</p>
