        <p>This is my first day journaling.</p>
        <p>
          And this is the second day after I was kicked out from MULTI project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew it would come, but when it came, it hurt. Since the beginning
          of January, I started feeling that I was not welcomed anymore in this
          team: Luuk ignored my messages, Matthias lost patience when answering
          my questions. My work on RPC discovery was not appreciated at all.
          Every question I asked exposed a tip of my ignorance to them. And was
          yesterday, I was asked to get out there. I did feel unfair as they
          didn&#x27;t seems to give me more chances: they started throwing
          trivial and random tasks to me since they found I did not perform well
          at the first task, fuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruud was a nice guy. But the more kind he tried to be to me, the more
          miserable I seem to be. I&#x27;ve been always telling myself that I am
          not a smart guy, but when others tell me that in my face, I am upset.
          It seems I don&#x27;t truly believe I am not smart, I want to prove so
          bad, but I keep on failing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think positively: one good news is that I have a second chance to
          prove myself in a different team, I can&#x27;t fail again. Maybe I
          always set a low standard to myself and didn&#x27;t realize it, it
          might be a good thing that someone pointed that out for me (and slap
          on my face).
        </p>
        <p>
          The other good news is that I am not that kind of person who gets
          stuck at sadness, I felt much better today. Life is not going at the
          direction where I want it to be, but what else can I do? Things
          already happened, and I need to look forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, Journaling is the thing that I think I can do for a month, in
          order to be more mindful: telling what I am feeling to myself, no
          matter it&#x27;s good or bad, face it. This will be my first English
          journal, there is no reason why I write in English, I just want to
          challenge myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will talk to you tomorrow Jet, hope you will be less ignorant 24
          hours later.
